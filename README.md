# National-Longitudinal-Survey-of-Youth-1997-2011
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011 dataset is one of the most important databases available to social scientists working with US data.

I used LinearRegression to try to predict earnings, first based on 2 variables then on 93! Analized earnings based on education, faith. Showed correlation between parents' eduacation and subject earnings. Arithmetic reasoning, word knowledge, paragraph comprehension, math knowledge score (ASVBC4). How does it effect earnings?

Furthermore, what is the most optimal height to maximalize earnings? Even Gaussian distribution showed in the way.
